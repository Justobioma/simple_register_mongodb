# NodeJs-Mongodb-Registration-App
This is my first successful app done with Node.js, Express JS, Mongodb, and pug templating engine.
It is a simple app built to test the flexibility of saving and retrieving data from a localised Mongodb collections database.
Node.js is the powerful engine which allows Express to build modern scalable applications and pug allows for the creation of static
html files needed on the frontend.
I hope to take this app a step further by bringing CSS to make the presentation more professional appealing.
